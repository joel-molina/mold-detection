# Bread Mold Detector

## Goal
Develop a system that can classify and detect bread mold. This is alongside extra considerations on the frontend for an accessible and simple site for those with poor vision or colorblindness.

## Tools
Developed using a flask backend and a vanilla HTML-CSS-JS frontend.

## Instructions to Run
Assuming all of the requirements are installed to run this program (requirements.txt needs updating), this can be ran by:
1. Opening the terminal
2. switching to the backend folder
3. Running "python main.py"
